# School project: implementation of an emergency bracelet for student parties

## Overall project goal

Our team project was to develop a bracelet with an emergency button, which would send an alert to security when pressed. It was designed for school/universities parties, being discrete while facing an akward situation with an insistent individual for instance.

## My contribution

I was in charge of designing from scratch the React Native application, along with the server so as to establish a client-server communication. This is the final prototype, but still is a prototype. 
The repository contain two main folders: 
  - HTTP Server, containing the Node.JS server, which communicate with an extern database where users profiles are stored;
  - ReactNative app, containing the React Native mobile application.
